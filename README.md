# SuperNOVA Graphical Overhaul

What this mod does:

Replaces the vanilla ship spritesheets, and the target, hail and info pictures with their Supernova Shipyard equivalents. As of version 1.4.0 it also makes the following graphical changes to select weapon resources based on Nova 1.1 (last mac version's) data.
 
For a ship-by-ship Graphical Breakdown please visit this wiki page.

What this mod does not do:

    Add any of the custom ships not found in the vanilla scenarios from Supernova
    Make any non-graphical changes or changes to the names of ships found in the vanilla scenario


This mod should be compatible with everything that doesn't change shan's, so it should work with ShipVariants, weapon fixes etc. I highly recommend both NeoPlanets and the WinNova ResPatcher to be used with this mod, as I've found the much larger ships of Supernova to look disproportionate otherwise.
